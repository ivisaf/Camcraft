//! Reduced-fidelity models (#864): a STEP model whose kept mesh is coarser
//! than the importer promises - the flag, what the gouge verdicts do about
//! it, and the program gate's refusal once they cannot be honest.
//!
//! Provenance: our own design (maintainer decision on #864). A facet of a
//! curved wall is a chord of the true surface and stands inside it by its
//! sagitta (elementary geometry), so against the mesh a convex wall looks
//! farther from the tool than the real one is. No vendor material consulted.
//!
//! ## The law here
//!
//! - A model carries [`ReducedFidelity`] exactly when its import kept a
//!   chord error above `step::CHORD_CAP`. Its EXCESS is that error less
//!   the cap: how much more a verdict against the mesh can forgive than
//!   the same verdict against a model that met the promise.
//! - While a verdict tolerance less the excess stays positive, the gouge
//!   laws judge with that smaller tolerance (`VerifyContext::model_excess`
//!   at generation, [`verdict_tol`] for the program sim): stricter, never
//!   looser. False gouges on a concave wall are the safe side.
//! - Once the excess uses a whole tolerance, a tightened law would convict
//!   every exactly finished flat face - a misleading verdict. The laws
//!   then read untightened and [`gate_problems`] refuses the operation by
//!   name at the post; the program sim does not judge at all.
//! - A kind whose own laws do not read the excess yet
//!   (`operation::fidelity_law::excess_aware`) is refused on any reduced
//!   model: a refusal is the only verdict that cannot be looser. #904
//!   took turning, the rotary kinds and the multi-axis ball kinds off
//!   that list; `fidelity_law`'s header says which law judges which.
//! - A stock copied from a model carries the model's flag itself (#1056):
//!   it holds the same facets, so deleting or renaming the model never
//!   makes the laws stop tightening on them. The copy is written by
//!   `SetStock`, `UpdateModel`'s propagation, the setup clones and the
//!   loader, and saved with the project. A stock from a file that predates
//!   its own flag still reads its source's, and adopts it on load.
//! - When the gate refuses an operation here, the program sim and the
//!   eye's colours read no verdict either ([`program_tol`]): the named
//!   refusal is the one line said, never a gouge read off the same mesh.
//! - A mesh whose fidelity is NOT KNOWN (#1056: every mesh of a project
//!   saved before v59 without a recorded chord, `project::fidelity_migrate`)
//!   carries the sentinel chord [`UNKNOWN_MM`]: no tolerance survives it,
//!   so every operation judged against it, and the program verdict, are
//!   refused by name ([`UNKNOWN_NOTE`]), never tightened by a guess. It
//!   rides every path the flag rides (copies, clones, undo, save) and only
//!   a fresh import clears it.
