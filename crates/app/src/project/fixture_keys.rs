//! The fixture marker's optional parameter keys read leniently (#812):
//! a `vise` or `accessory` key this build can't parse (a kind a later
//! release added, a missing or mistyped field) or one that breaks its
//! law is dropped on its own - the fixture and its saved steel stay, as
//! plain steel - with a load note the user sees, never a failed load.
//! The keys are held as raw JSON on the wire so serde never refuses the
//! whole file over one of them (the shape #819's plate keys took).
//!
//! Provenance: our own wire handling over `vise::ViseParams` and
//! `accessory::Accessory`.
