//! `ElectrodeFromFaces` (#547): a sinker EDM electrode generated from
//! the picked faces of a part's cavity, added to the document as a tool
//! (#541's electrode kind) in one undo step.
//!
//! Provenance: our own command model - validation at construction,
//! `apply` a pure world write, the inverse `AddTool`'s own - over the
//! derivation in `operation::sinker_faces` (whose sources its module
//! head and the motion crate's cite). No vendor material.
