//! SetRibbonPins: pin or unpin operation kinds on the ribbon (issue #143).
//!
//! Pins are saved in the project file, so changing them changes the
//! document: it goes through the history (as the theme did before
//! #877), can be undone, and counts as an unsaved change. The command
//! writes only the `RibbonPins` singleton (through `ribbon::pinned_set`) and its inverse
//! writes the previous list back. Provenance: our own command, mirroring
//! our own `theme.rs`; specced from issue #143 and AGENTS.md's
//! "Everything Is a Command".
