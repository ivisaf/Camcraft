//! The post-serves-kind door (#1232): a section reaches a post only
//! when that post serves the kind of machine its setup runs on.
//!
//! Provenance: our own rule, read off [`super::post_serves`] (the
//! picker's listing law, M13.5) and made binding at post time. That a
//! milling program (XY plane, tool change, tool spindle) cannot drive a
//! two-axis lathe, nor a cutting program a torch or a wire, is general
//! machining knowledge from the machine-tool handbooks. No vendor
//! material consulted.
//!
//! The law: before any NC text is written, every mount the program
//! posts (whole program, one file per mount, one file per operation)
//! is asked whether its post serves its machine's kind. A shipped post
//! is judged by its registry name ([`super::post_serves`]); a script of
//! the user's own by the dialect its manifest declares (the
//! `capabilities` mask, [`crate::post::dialect::work_voice`]): a lathe
//! takes only a script that declares turning, a mill or a plasma table
//! refuses one that declares turning, and no undeclared user script
//! serves an EDM (the registry's wire posts serve a wire EDM, #533, and
//! its sinker posts a sinker EDM, #542 - each the only door for its
//! kind since the "no post yet" refusal retired). A refusal names the
//! setup, its operations, the post and the machine's kind - nothing is
//! posted.
//!
//! A user's script states the kinds it serves in its manifest
//! (`serves = ["plasma"];`, #1266): it then posts to exactly those
//! kinds. One that states none is accepted only where its dialect
//! proves it (turning serves a lathe and a mill-turn, a non-turning
//! one a mill and a mill-turn); a plasma table and an EDM are refused
//! for it, and the refusal says to declare `serves`.
//!
//! And per section (maintainer, 2026-11-12, on a mill-turn): a section
//! that turns the work - a turning op or an on-centre drill, as
//! [`crate::lathe_voice::voice_of`] reads it - posts only through a
//! post whose dialect is turning ([`work_voice`] `WorkSpindle`). On a
//! lathe or a mill-turn a milling post would write it for the TOOL
//! spindle (a turning insert spun at the section's rpm, the facing
//! pass as Y moves): refused by name. Milling and C-axis sections on a
//! mill-turn still post through a milling post.
