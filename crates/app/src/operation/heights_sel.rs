//! Heights measured from the operation's own selection (M11.3 A): the Z
//! span of the geometry an operation machines, read through the same
//! feature walk generation runs. Provenance: our own design notes and
//! the public CAM convention of a height "from the selection"; no
//! vendor material consulted.
//!
//! The rule, per source - the span is (lowest Z, highest Z) in WORLD
//! coordinates, through each entity's placement:
//!
//! - `SrcRef::Selection` - the union over every pick of:
//!   - a picked face: its boundary loops' vertices (a planar face's Z
//!     extent is its boundary's; a flat face's span is its own Z, twice);
//!   - a welded wall (patch): every strip face of the weld, same rule -
//!     so a dome's crown counts even where no rim runs over it;
//!   - an edge chain (closed loop or open run): its points.
//! - `SrcRef::Entity` - that entity's world bounding box.
//! - `SrcRef::Stock` - the setup's stock box. The stock IS the selection
//!   of a stock-sourced operation; resolving (not refusing) means a
//!   later source change can never strand a height that was legal when
//!   it was written - it re-resolves against the new source, the op goes
//!   Stale, and the panel echoes the new Z.
//!
//! Top / Clearance / Retract take the highest Z, Bottom the lowest (the
//! reference names its end: [`HeightReference::TopOfSelection`] /
//! [`HeightReference::BottomOfSelection`]); the offset adds as for every
//! other reference. A selection that yields no finite Z refuses by name
//! - never a silent 0.
