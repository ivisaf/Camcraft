//! The area-controls law (M11.5), pure: no world, no entity. The
//! world reads that feed it (stock outline, part material, picked
//! boundaries) are resolved into an [`AreaCtx`] by `boundary_ctx` on the
//! caller's thread; `area::apply_area_controls` is the one seam that
//! runs this law, last, on every region an operation cuts.
//!
//! Order of the law, each step named in the empty-area refusal:
//! 1. open boundary - the picked chain (extended straight past its ends)
//!    or ring splits the stock outline; the chosen side replaces the
//!    selection's area,
//! 2. offset - grow / shrink, round or sharp corners,
//! 3. extension - past the exterior edges (no part material beyond):
//!    Face runs out to the stock outline and on by the distance, the
//!    other kinds by the distance,
//! 4. include boundaries (union), then the part's own material at the
//!    cut planes is taken out again (the pocket island law),
//! 5. tool containment - inside / on / outside, as an offset relative to
//!    what the kind's generator does natively with its region,
//! 6. exclude boundaries - after containment for the clearing kinds (the
//!    tool body stays out), before it for the contour (they shape the
//!    ring it rides).
//!
//! Provenance: our own design notes; the region booleans and offsets are
//! the clipper2 bridge (`geo2d`), the side test is the plane-sweep
//! textbook construction of closing an open polyline against a far
//! circle. No vendor material consulted.
