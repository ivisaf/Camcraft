//! Picked part faces read as a sinker EDM cavity (#547): each pick
//! resolved by its stable feature id into a world-space face (outward
//! normal by the facets' winding, outer boundary ring), the cavity and
//! its electrode derived by the motion crate, and the model checked for
//! anything standing in the electrode's way.
//!
//! Provenance: our own glue over this repo's feature topology
//! (`geometry::feature`), the one pick rule (#692, `pick::feature_sel`)
//! and the motion crate's `sinker_cavity` / `sinker_electrode`, whose
//! module heads cite their public sources (the depression-feature rule,
//! the polygon offset, general die-sink EDM practice). No vendor
//! material.
