//! The Sinker Burn operation's seed, condition read and generation
//! (#541): the op's stored numbers resolved against the world (heights,
//! the electrode's length, the setup machine's spark gap) and
//! `sinker::burn_to_depth` run over them.
//!
//! Provenance: our own glue over the motion crate's sinker generator,
//! whose module head cites its public sources (general die-sink EDM
//! practice); the condition table is #531's user data (#290 D4).
