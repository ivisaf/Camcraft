//! The Wire Contour's verification inputs (#534, part of #290 D7): the
//! op's cached path, its condition's kerf offset, its stated side and
//! start hole, and the part's and stock's sections through the whole
//! height the vertical wire passes - handed to `verify::wire::judge`.
//! Provenance: our own glue over the sim crate's wire laws (whose
//! module head cites the public sources) and the slicer; read live at
//! the post, as the plasma clause reads its paths.
