//! The Sinker Side Burn operation's seed, creation law and generation
//! (#545): the op's burn resolved as the Sinker Burn's is (#541's
//! `sinker_op` doors - heights, electrode, condition gap), then
//! `sinker_side::side_burn` run over it with the side's own numbers.
//!
//! Provenance: our own glue over the motion crate's side-burn
//! generator, whose module head cites its public sources (lateral EDM
//! burning in public machining texts); the condition table is #531's
//! user data (#290 D4).
