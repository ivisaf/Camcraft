//! What an operation kind's gouge verdicts need of its model's fidelity
//! (#864, #904): the tolerance its envelope law is judged at, the
//! smallest tolerance any of its laws holds, and whether those laws read
//! a coarse model's excess at all.
//!
//! Provenance: our own registry of our own verify laws; `finish_tol_of`
//! is the envelope budget `generate` always handed to `verify`, moved
//! here unchanged so the program gate reads the same number.
//!
//! ## Which law judges which kind (#904)
//!
//! A kind is judged on a reduced-fidelity model only when EVERY law that
//! convicts it against the model reads the excess; otherwise it is
//! refused at the program gate.
//!
//! - Turning, the nose kinds (facing, profile, chamfer, taper, multi-
//!   pass, boring): `verify`'s envelope law (f) on the nose circle.
//! - Turning, the band kinds (groove, part, thread, form): the meridian
//!   scan (`turning::*_warnings_excess`), and for a Part's inspection
//!   ask the composed scan at the post (`operation::probe`).
//! - Every turning kind: the meridian rapid, bar-feed and holder scans,
//!   whose margin is tightened the same way ([`tightened`]).
//! - The rotary kinds: law (f), and the radial field law's band and
//!   rapid allowances (`rotary_law`).
//! - The multi-axis ball kinds (5-axis contour and parallel, flow,
//!   multi-axis contour and rough): law (f) - a posed ball is the same
//!   ball about the same centre, so the envelope scan is the whole
//!   gouge verdict of the cut.
//! - Probe (#1053): its protected-move law (`probe_op::stylus_hits` and
//!   the stem and body bands of `stylus_reach_hits`) - the stylus slack
//!   gives the excess back (`probe_op::stylus_slack`). A probe cuts
//!   nothing, so no other law reads it.
//! - Plasma (#1053): the kerf law and the cover law
//!   (`plasma::PlasmaParams::kerf_tol`), the only laws that read the
//!   part; the cut-order, kerf-crossing and tip-up laws read the path.
//!
//! Still refused, each for its reason:
//!
//! - Swarf and advanced swarf: the flank that does the cutting is proved
//!   clear only inside the generator (`multiaxis::stamp_pose`,
//!   `flank_clear` at the plan tolerance); no verify law re-measures it,
//!   so there is nothing here to tighten until that proof reads the
//!   excess (#1052).
//! - The cone rides (2D chamfer, deburr) and the engrave rides (trace,
//!   engrave): no law holds them to a tolerance against the model at
//!   all. The ride IS the mesh's edge by construction (law (b) stands
//!   down for both modes), so the cut stands off the true edge by the
//!   mesh's own chord error, which no reading of that mesh can see or
//!   bound - there is no tolerance to give the excess back from. Worse,
//!   deburr finds its edges by the bend between facets: a coarse mesh
//!   of a smooth face bends more between neighbours and can be read as
//!   a crease the ride then breaks - a cut no verify law speaks to.
//!   Judging them needs a stated ride accuracy, a new promise, not a
//!   tightened one (#1053's decision file).
//! - The cross drill: its part law (`cross_part`, `GOUGE_TOL`) and its
//!   rapid law (`rapids_radial`) could give the excess back, but the
//!   chain is also proved by construction laws that measure the mesh
//!   with no slack at all - the standoff radius and Z top the kernel
//!   stations about (`cross_stock::standoff`, `rapids_clear`), the
//!   entry along each hole's line (`cross_entry`), the flute reach and
//!   holder faces (`drill_reach`). Each reads a coarse mesh's chord
//!   error straight through; tightening them means growing every
//!   measured standoff by the excess, which moves the kernel's
//!   stations. Left for #1053's remainder.
