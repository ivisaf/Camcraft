//! Machine definitions and program limits (M2.3 stage C).
//!
//! Provenance: the `.mch` file layout is the machine-definition JSON
//! format reused by user instruction (our reader, our field semantics,
//! nothing copied from any vendor's parser or documentation beyond the
//! observable shape of a machine file); the limit-checking rules are
//! general machine-tool practice - a spindle has a speed range, an
//! axis has a feed ceiling and a stroke, and a tool table has a
//! length and diameter the magazine accepts.
//!
//! The design law: an UNSTATED limit checks nothing. Vendor machine
//! files carry zeros for speeds nobody configured, and a zero rapid
//! speed does not mean the machine cannot rapids - it means the file
//! doesn't say. Every number here is therefore an `Option`, and `0`
//! reads as `None`. A program judged against a sparse machine says
//! exactly what the machine file says, no more - the silent wrong
//! answer in its friendliest form would be a green checkmark earned
//! by inventing a ceiling.
//!
//! Travel is the same law with a sharper edge: standard machine files
//! carry no stroke numbers at all, so the check is live only when our
//! own files add a `"travel": {"min": .., "max": ..}` object to a
//! linear part. Those numbers are read in PROGRAM coordinates through
//! the active WCS - the file cannot know a work offset, and guessing a
//! machine origin would invent the very number the check needs. So a
//! stroke L is stated `-L..L` (the origin may sit anywhere along it);
//! a machine-frame `-500..0` refused every retract (#457).
//!
//! M3.3 stage C widened the readable grammar, all of it optional -
//! files written before stage C parse exactly as they always did:
//! `general.kind` declares what the machine IS (mill / lathe /
//! mill-turn; unstated means the axis inventory decides, stage E's
//! older law); `spindle.power` (kW), `tooling.number_of_tools` (the
//! changer's slots), and `tool_station.coolants` (names, with their
//! M-codes where the file states them) carry the full numbers; and
//! `"type": "rotary"` parts join the axis table with degrees for
//! travel and a `"resolution"` key for positioning steps. The mirror
//! to the post grammar (posting) now speaks coolants too, so a
//! mounted machine's coolant words are its own. M5.3 stage C added
//! the spindle INVENTORY - heads stating a spindle, counted
//! whole-tree - which is what makes a program's part transfer a
//! checkable claim instead of a hope.

//!
//! M4.1 R0 split (docs/M4.1-CRATE-SPLIT.md): the plain types live in
//! [`def`], the `.mch` reader in [`parse`]; this module keeps what
//! touches the world - the singleton glue and the program checker.

// M4.1 R3: the plain types and the `.mch` reader live in camcraft-post
// (crates/post/src/machine/); this module keeps only what touches the
// world - the singleton glue and the program checker.
