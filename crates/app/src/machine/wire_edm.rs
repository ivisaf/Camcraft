//! The machine check on a wire EDM (#532, part of #290): what a program
//! of wire cuts asks the machine, judged against what its file states.
//!
//! Provenance: our own rules over the umbrella's machine model (#290:
//! X/Y carry the lower guide and table, U/V the upper guide; the wire
//! is the machine's condition) and the unstated-limits law of
//! `assets/machines/AGENTS.md`. No vendor manual consulted.
//!
//! What is judged: the X/Y travel of every move against the stated
//! strokes, and the refusals by name - an op that is not wire EDM work,
//! and for a tapered cut (#536) every pose: its lean against the stated
//! maximum, and the upper guide's offset from the lower one (U/V,
//! from the stated guide planes) against the U and V strokes - no
//! guide planes, no U/V axis, or a lean or offset past what is stated
//! is refused by name. What is NOT: the wire sweep against the part,
//! the slug, the start hole's clearance (wire verification, #534), and
//! any tool number, rpm or feed - a wire EDM has no changer and no
//! spindle, and the control's generator sets the rate. Those are
//! SKIPPED with a named note on the check, never failed and never
//! silent.
