//! The machined volume unfolding with the playhead (M7.2 C): the
//! display field cut move by move up to the transport's position,
//! seeking backward from a checkpoint. Provenance: the M7.1 field
//! engine's order-independent subtraction (a running max of swept-tool
//! distances, so any prefix of the program is cut exactly by its own
//! moves); the checkpoint journal is plain periodic snapshotting.
//! Nothing from vendor binaries.
//!
//! ## The laws here
//!
//! - **Playback is the field's truth unfolding.** The stock shown at
//!   move `k` is the uncut stock minus exactly the program's first `k`
//!   moves - the same cut `stock_view::field_view` makes for all of
//!   them, so the last frame of playback IS the Deviate picture.
//! - **Backward seek re-applies from a checkpoint.** A snapshot of the
//!   cut stock is kept every `stride` moves on the way forward; seeking
//!   back clones the nearest one at or before the target and cuts the
//!   rest. The snapshot count is bounded (`MAX_CHECKPOINTS`), so memory
//!   is a constant multiple of one field, never proportional to moves.
//!   (Dirty-brick deltas instead of whole snapshots are M7.3's cost law.)
//! - **Only completed moves cut.** The move under the playhead has not
//!   finished, so it has not removed its material yet; a seek to the
//!   end cuts everything.
//! - **The timeline and the plan agree by name, or nothing plays.**
//!   The transport's script and the posting plan are walked by
//!   different callers; an operation the plan does not hold is a
//!   refusal, never a silent skip that would show material the
//!   machine removes as standing.
