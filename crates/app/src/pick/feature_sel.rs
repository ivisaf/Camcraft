//! From a resolved pick to the selection the pages store (#692 step 2):
//! a feature point is a `Vertex`, a welded face its `Face`/`Patch` key,
//! and a feature edge the `Chain` the asking page takes - the tangent
//! chain, the run (one straight stretch or one arc) or the one segment.
//! Plus the one rule read backwards, for picks made by id (MCP): a stored
//! vertex or chain is pickable only if a click could have landed on it.
//!
//! Provenance: our own code over this repo's `geometry::feature` chains
//! and runs (M1.5 / M11.5 design); no vendor material consulted.
