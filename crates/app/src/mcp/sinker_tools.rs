//! The MCP tool for a sinker EDM electrode generated from a cavity's
//! picked faces (#547): `electrode_from_faces`. It runs the app's
//! undoable `ElectrodeFromFaces`, so one `undo` removes the tool, and
//! every refusal - a face set that is no single rectangular cavity, a
//! garbled number, a taken name - comes back as its text.
//!
//! Provenance: our own tool surface over this repo's command layer.
