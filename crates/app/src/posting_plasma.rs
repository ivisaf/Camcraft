//! The verification gate's plasma clause (#672): the through-cut laws
//! of `sim::verify::plasma` run over every Plasma Profile op's cached
//! path, made binding - a refusal blocks the post the way a located
//! gouge does - and the not-judged line that says the 3D stock sim did
//! not run for the torch and what judged it instead.
//! Provenance: our own design (the Prime Directive's "correct, or
//! visibly refused" read onto the M2.3 D gate, as `posting_sim` does
//! for the stock sim); the laws cite UM10720 and the LinuxCNC Plasma
//! Primer in their own module.
//!
//! ## The law here
//!
//! The material sim (`stock_sim`) carves nothing for a torch: the dexel
//! column has no atom for a kerf cut through the plate, so it skips
//! the op and its verdict says nothing about it. That silence must not
//! read as a pass. Every Plasma Profile in the program is judged here
//! from its own CL records (`PlasmaProgram::from_toolpath` - the torch
//! spans, never re-parsed text): cut order, cut crossing and a malformed
//! record refuse by name; kerf crossing and tip-up warn, named on the
//! line. An op with no path, or a path with no record, is a problem in
//! its own right - two missing judges never add up to a pass.
