//! Built-in 5-axis self-centering vises (#787, part of #339): both jaws
//! close on the vise's centre, so the clamped width is set from the stock
//! and the stock sits centred on the vise. Short, tall and narrow for tool
//! clearance in tilted work; judged by the same fixture laws as any meshed
//! fixture, upright and posed (#339 slice 3).
//!
//! The frame: x across the jaws (centred on the jaw width), y along the
//! screw with the origin midway between the jaw faces (faces at
//! y = +-opening/2, each jaw's body `jaw_body_depth` deep behind its face),
//! z = 0 the floor the part sits on, the body below it down to
//! `-base_height`. An optional dovetail lip is a step `lip_depth` deep at
//! each clamping face, `lip_height` above the jaw top, drawn solid: the
//! dovetail's undercut is filled, so the laws see at least the real steel.
//!
//! Provenance: our own geometry and parameters; the size table's figures
//! are typical values from public catalog spec sheets (cited in
//! `docs/decisions/787-self-centering-vises.md`), no vendor model copied.
//! The prism and its ear-clipped cap are the textbook method `vise::mesh`
//! uses (Meisters, "Polygons have ears", 1975).
