//! Wire EDM 2.5D verification (#534, part of #290 D7): a vertical
//! 2-axis wire cut judged on the program plane against the part's
//! sections through the whole height the wire passes.
//!
//! - **Kerf law.** The wire burns a slot of half-width `k` (wire radius
//!   plus spark gap) along every move, through every height between its
//!   guides. A move whose kerf comes nearer the product's section than
//!   `k` - or stands in it - is a gouge, named by its move.
//! - **Threading law.** The wire is threaded at the start hole through
//!   the full height: the product must stand clear of the threading
//!   point by `k` at every judged plane. A start hole that is not
//!   stated, or that the path does not start from, is refused by name.
//! - **Slug law.** The kerf region is subtracted from the material
//!   section (stock and part); the connected pieces enclosed by the cut
//!   are what drops free when the cut closes. A die keeps the material
//!   outside the cut, so its freed piece must hold none of the product;
//!   a punch's freed piece IS the product. A cut that frees nothing, or
//!   frees the wrong side, is refused by name. A no-core burnout (#540)
//!   reads the other way: it must free nothing - a freed piece is a
//!   core left to drop, refused.
//!
//! An OPEN run (#1109, side left / right of travel) is threaded in the
//! air outside the stock and leaves it at a run-out point: it has no
//! start hole and closes no slug, so the threading and slug laws do not
//! apply and say so ([`OPEN_SKIP`]). The kerf law judges it against the
//! part as for any cut, and its ends - where the wire is threaded and
//! cut - must stand clear of the stock by the kerf offset.
//!
//! The product's section by the stated side: a punch's product is the
//! model. A die's product is the model too when the start hole stands
//! outside it (the model is a die plate, the opening a hole in it); when
//! the start hole stands IN the model, the model is the opening (the
//! slug's shape, #532's whole-model die) and the product is the stock
//! around it.
//!
//! A constant taper (#536): the moves state poses (D2: the wire's
//! direction from its lower-plane point toward the upper guide), and
//! the wire at height `z` stands at `to + pose * (z - to.z) / pose.z`,
//! both ends interpolating along a move - the ruled surface. Every law
//! reads the wire's own section at each judged height, and the kerf
//! across a leaning wire is the ellipse its disc cuts from the plane:
//! `k * sqrt(1 + (t.u)^2)` toward the product in direction `u`, `t`
//! the wire's lean per unit height. Poses are read only from a cut that
//! states a taper; any other posed move stays unreadable.
//!
//! Provenance: plain 2D distance and region geometry (point-segment
//! distance, polygon booleans and the disc sweep of `geo2d`, clipper2)
//! over the public wire EDM practice the umbrella #290 cites: the kerf
//! is the wire diameter plus the gap on both sides, the wire is
//! threaded through a start hole, and a closed cut frees the enclosed
//! region (die slug or punch). Our own code; no vendor post, control
//! manual or CAM product behaviour was consulted.
