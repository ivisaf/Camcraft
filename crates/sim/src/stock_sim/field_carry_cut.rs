//! Cuts in the new frame on a carried field (#637 E2c, route (ii) of the
//! step-E design): the turn's signed permutation is baked into the bricks
//! (`SdfField::turned`, E2a) the first time a carried field is cut, so the
//! view keeps only the translation; the moves are shifted by that
//! translation into the baked field's own frame and subtracted through
//! `Stock::simulate`'s field arm (`simulate_field`): the same tool
//! construction (`spanning_flank`), batched per brick. Every later cut
//! rides the shipped `+Z` code - true XY arcs (#413), the closed-form flat
//! floor - and a flipped bake's floor under an earlier cut is read by the
//! up-march from the records the bake moved (`cut_downs`, E2b).
//!
//! ## The laws here
//!
//! - **A translation moves an arc whole.** `from`, `to` and the centre
//!   shift by the same vector, in the plane's own word order
//!   (`ArcPlane::words`): sense, plane and radius are unchanged, so an XY
//!   arc stays a true arc on the field. The tool axis is a direction and
//!   does not move. Nothing is re-sampled.
//! - **Refusals come first.** `check_ops` runs on the moves as the caller
//!   stated them, before the bake or a single cell is written - a bad
//!   program leaves the carried stock as it was, as `Stock::simulate` does.
//!   A shift that overflows a move to a non-finite value is refused by the
//!   same gate inside `simulate_field`, before any subtraction; the bake
//!   that ran by then changed the representation, never the solid (E2a's
//!   view equivalence).
//! - **The clip stays at read-back.** A cut and the clip block are both
//!   intersections with the carried solid, so they commute; the clip is
//!   applied where it always was (`distance`, `inside`, `column_body`).
//! - **The bake is lazy and once per turn.** A view that is already a pure
//!   translation is cut as it stands; a later `then` adds a new turn to the
//!   view, and the next cut bakes that one.
//!
//! Provenance: rigid-motion invariance of the Euclidean distance; the
//! RS-274 arc's centre words (`cl::plane`); our own design (#637 step-E
//! research comment, section 3).
