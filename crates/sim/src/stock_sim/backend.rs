//! The stock seam (M7.1 C): one API, two engines.
//!
//! Provenance: the column arm is the dexel that has answered every
//! verdict since M2.1; the field arm is the brick SDF of M7.1 A/B,
//! its heights read by the ray march in `march`. Nothing from vendor
//! binaries.
//!
//! ## The laws here
//!
//! - **A verdict says the same thing either way.** `deviate`,
//!   `measure`, and `surface` answer in HEIGHTS on the stock's own XY
//!   lattice - the column engine's vocabulary - so a `Deviation` or
//!   `StockReport` can be compared value for value across arms, and
//!   every aggregate (rest, gouge, their locations, NaN for the
//!   columns that judge nothing) is the same law computed twice.
//! - **Refusals are backend-independent.** Every gate a column arm
//!   refuses through, the field arm refuses through with the same
//!   words, checked the same order before a single cell is written;
//!   a program that will not run runs nowhere. The field's two extra
//!   truths - watertightness (the parity needs it) and a chord whose
//!   window would span the grid - refuse BY NAME and are honest
//!   over-strictness, never a silent pass.
//! - **The flat tool's flank spans the verdict world** (see
//!   `spanning_flank`): the column atom is an infinite cylinder, and
//!   the field makes that law exact below the world's ceiling by
//!   giving the solid a flank that reaches past anything a verdict
//!   can stand on. Where the spanning law cannot reach (a path below
//!   the march floor, the truncated cone's chimney above its max
//!   radius) the field shows MORE rest than the column - the blessed
//!   direction: rest over-reported is noise, rest hidden is a gouge
//!   waiting.
//! - **The column arm is what ships.** App and motion still build
//!   `Dexel` directly; routing those call sites through this seam is
//!   M7.3's retirement march, with the parity suite here as its
//!   safety law. Until then the field is the verifiable second
//!   opinion, which is exactly what a new engine should be.
