//! The field's cost law (M7.3): a cut walks only the bricks its sweep
//! can change, and a batch of moves visits each brick once.
//!
//! Provenance: the brick-map discipline the Phase 7 reference note
//! names (dirty bricks from a sweep's reach, never a dense window),
//! with every skip proved from the same 1-Lipschitz bound the sphere
//! tracer stands on (Hart's law: a distance bounds what can change
//! within it). Nothing from vendor binaries.
//!
//! ## The laws here
//!
//! - **Skips are proofs, never opinions.** A cut changes `distance`
//!   only where the mesh term is not `+cap`; outside `region` (the
//!   allocated band and the shell's box, dilated) it is `+cap` by
//!   construction, so no claim there can move an answer. Inside, a
//!   brick whose center stands `cap` + its half-diagonal clear of the
//!   swept solid holds no cell the per-cell law would claim; a brick
//!   whose center is that deep INSIDE holds only cells the law clamps
//!   to `cap` (and whose vertical entry is the center itself). Both
//!   bounds carry the golden section's own residual as slack, so the
//!   fast path writes bit for bit what the per-cell walk would.
//! - **A full cell is final.** `cap` is the cut layer's ceiling, and
//!   a cell at `cap` answers air whatever the mesh says, so its
//!   ray-entry companion is never read (the march reads it only at a
//!   material center): later claims on it are skipped, and a brick
//!   whose 512 cells are all full is skipped whole.
//! - **Batches commute.** The layers are a running max and a running
//!   min, so walking a batch brick-major (every sweep that reaches a
//!   brick, while it is hot) answers exactly what move-major does -
//!   and a long program stops re-walking the same brick per move.
