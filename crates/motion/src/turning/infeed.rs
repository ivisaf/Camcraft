//! The threading infeed plan (issue #416): how the passes of a
//! single-point thread grow the groove from the crest to the root -
//! which way each pass enters (radial, along one flank, or
//! alternating flanks), how deep each pass goes (constant depth, or
//! constant chip area by the square root of the pass number with a
//! minimum per pass), the finish allowance the finishing pass takes,
//! and the spring passes at full depth after it.
//!
//! The safety law is containment: every pass's V must stand inside the
//! finished V, or a roughing pass cuts flank the finishing pass was
//! meant to leave. A pass `h` above the root, shifted `h * tan(theta)`
//! along the axis, keeps both its flanks inside the finished V exactly
//! when `theta` is no more than the insert's half-angle - so a flank
//! angle past it is refused by name, and the finishing and spring
//! passes always stand on the lattice centre itself (no shift). The
//! shift moves where a pass STARTS on the lattice, never its lead: the
//! helix phase (spindle angle at a station) is the lattice's for every
//! pass.
//!
//! Provenance: the infeed methods (radial, modified flank at a compound
//! angle a little under half the included angle, alternating flank),
//! the decreasing-depth (constant-area, first depth times the square
//! root of the pass number) schedule with a minimum depth per pass, the
//! finish allowance and spring passes, as public tooling-maker guides
//! (Sandvik Coromant "How to choose infeed method" and thread-turning
//! application tips; ISCAR threading handbook) and the public G76
//! references (GSK988TA manual G76 section, Fanuc-compatible; the
//! LinuxCNC G-code reference, G76) describe them - behaviour only. The
//! containment proof and the pass layout are our own. No vendor
//! strategy, post or output consulted.
