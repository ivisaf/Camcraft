//! Multi-axis roughing (M5.1 stage E3): the level ladder of
//! [`crate::machining3d::pocket3d`] with the stage-C stamp read over
//! it, so every move that ends in tangency poses along the surface it
//! is cutting - steep flanks take the tool OFF vertical (within the
//! max-tilt cone, lead and lag folded as in finishing), floors and
//! air keep it honest. The positions are the prismatic ladder's,
//! move for move and bit for bit: a sphere's envelope is
//! rotation-invariant about its own center, so leaning the spindle
//! cannot gouge a micrometre that the vertical cut did not already
//! own - which is why the rough rides law (f) verify like its
//! finishing siblings, and why collision-aware auto-tilt (stage F)
//! is a refinement of THIS pose law, never a precondition of it.
//!
//! What separates the kind from a 3+2 tilt (stage B) is the same
//! thing that separates contour5d from a tilted waterline: the part
//! stands still and the tool axis moves per move; one index cannot
//! hold the poses this ladder's flanks ask for.
//!
//! Provenance: 5-axis roughing with tool-axis control over a
//! z-level staircase is standard practice in the public multi-axis
//! CAM manuals; built from this codebase's own pocket ladder and
//! stage-C stamp. No vendor material consulted.
