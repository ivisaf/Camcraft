//! Path quality, measured (M11.4 C): what a roughing path actually does
//! to the tool, read off the stock simulation - never off the planner's
//! nominal step. Per path: the radial engagement (contact angle) along
//! every planar cut, sampled against the material standing the instant
//! before each sample cuts; its maximum, where it happened and its
//! distribution; the curvature breaks (tangent changes past a threshold
//! while the tool is in material) and the tightest in-cut curvature;
//! the air-cut length and time; the retract count.
//!
//! Provenance: the engagement (immersion) angle of peripheral milling
//! as the machining-dynamics literature defines it (Altintas,
//! *Manufacturing Automation*, ch. 2: the arc of the cutter periphery
//! in contact with the workpiece; for a straight wall
//! `acos(1 - 2 ae/D)`), sampled on the existing stock engine through
//! its seam (`camcraft_sim::stock_sim::Stock`, column arm; M7.3) the way
//! simulation-based engagement studies measure it (e.g. Kloypayan &
//! Lee 2002, material engagement from an in-process stock model). The
//! rim is read a cell and a half inside the cutter (the grid never reads
//! its own cut edge). The sampling law, thresholds and
//! report are ours; no vendor material.
