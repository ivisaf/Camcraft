//! Wire EDM 2-axis contour (#532, part of #290): one closed profile cut
//! through the workpiece by a vertical wire. The wire-centre path is
//! the profile's parallel at the kerf offset - the wire radius plus the
//! condition's spark gap per side - on the STATED side: inside the
//! profile for a die (the opening is the product, the slug falls out),
//! outside it for a punch (the profile is the product). The cut starts
//! and ends at a stated start hole / threading point, joined to the
//! path by a straight lead.
//!
//! Provenance: general wire EDM practice as the public literature the
//! umbrella cites states it (#290: the EDM review papers on wire
//! diameter, kerf and spark gap; the public design guides on start
//! holes and inside corners) - the wire-centre path is the profile
//! offset by wire radius plus gap, an enclosed cut is threaded through
//! a start hole, and no inside corner can be cut tighter than that
//! offset - read through the umbrella's decisions D1, D2 and D8. The
//! parallel curve is the textbook polygon offset
//! (`geo2d::Region::offset_sharp`, clipper2); the leads and the laws
//! are plain 2D geometry. Our own code; no vendor post, control manual
//! table or CAM product behaviour was consulted.
//!
//! The path is the wire-centre truth on the lower programmed plane.
//! Its moves state no pose (D2: a vertical cut posts as plain XY) and
//! no feed (the control's generator sets the rate from the condition).
//! Nothing here guesses: an open, crossing or area-less profile, a
//! missing or misplaced start hole, an inside corner or a neck the wire
//! cannot cut - each is refused by name, never trimmed or rounded.
//!
//! An OPEN run (#1109) - a cut-off line, a slot or a relief entered
//! from the stock's edge - is cut by `open`: the kerf on the stated
//! left or right of the run's travel, threaded outside the stock (no
//! start hole), see that module's head.
//!
//! Seams left for the family (built by none of this): the wire post
//! (#533) reads the feed moves between the threading point's visits;
//! verification (#534), taper as a pose per move (#536), skims as
//! further offsets (#538) and tabs (#539) stand on this path; the
//! no-core burnout of a pocket (#540) is `burnout`.
