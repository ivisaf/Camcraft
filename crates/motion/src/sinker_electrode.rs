//! The sinker EDM electrode a cavity calls for (#547): the cavity's
//! outline offset inward by the electrode's undersize (and an orbit
//! radius, when one is stated), extended above the cavity's mouth to a
//! holder stub - as the box electrode of #541, or a refusal by name.
//!
//! Provenance: general die-sink EDM practice from public machine-tool
//! handbooks - an electrode is the cavity's shape made smaller by a
//! per-side undersize, and smaller again by the radius of any orbit it
//! is to run, so its burn reaches the finished size; it stands proud of
//! the work so its holder never enters the cavity. The inward offset is
//! the polygon offset of the geometry crate (`geo2d::Region`, Clipper2's
//! published algorithm: Vatti clipping with mitred joins), and the
//! obstruction test is Sutherland & Hodgman's polygon clipping
//! ("Reentrant polygon clipping", CACM 17(1), 1974) of each facet
//! against the cavity's column. The refusals are our own design (#290
//! D1-D10). No vendor material.
//!
//! What it makes: the stock sim burns an electrode with the box atom
//! (`stock_sim::simulate_box`, #541) - an axis-aligned rectangular face.
//! So only a cavity whose outline IS an axis-aligned rectangle yields an
//! electrode here; every other outline is refused by name rather than
//! handed to a sim that would burn the wrong shape (#1152 owns the body
//! electrode). The offset outline is still computed and carried, for
//! that successor.
