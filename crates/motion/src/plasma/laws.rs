//! The plasma cut's certification laws (#670, #672), run over the moves
//! just laid down, before the path leaves the generator:
//!
//! - **Kerf law.** Every lit move of a closed contour keeps its kerf off
//!   the part: no chord point lies inside the part grown by kerf / 2
//!   (less [`KERF_TOL`]). A cut that would reach the part is refused by
//!   name, never trimmed.
//! - **Cover law** (#676 decision 12, #672). Every edge of a closed
//!   contour is reached by its own cut's kerf: no point of the nominal
//!   contour stands farther than one kerf width from the lit centre line.
//!   An outward offset bridges a slot or notch narrower than the kerf
//!   (and an inward offset drops a keyway narrower than the kerf from a
//!   hole) without splitting or closing a loop, so the ring law in
//!   [`super::ring::kerf_ring`] accepts it and the feature is silently
//!   left in the material. Here it is refused by name. The allowance is
//!   one kerf width (2 r) plus the tolerance, outside the tip zone of
//!   each inside corner (#791 review): the torch, radius r, can get no
//!   nearer an inside corner of opening θ than r / sin(θ/2) along its
//!   bisector, where its circle touches each wall r / tan(θ/2) from the
//!   vertex - so the stretch of wall the best possible path leaves more
//!   than 2 r away, r (tan(δ/2) − √3) from the vertex (δ = π − θ, the
//!   turn), is the uncut tip every plasma inside corner has, not a
//!   bridged feature, and is not judged. It is empty for openings of
//!   60° and more; a 30° V-notch keeps 1.5 mm of each wall. Uncovered
//!   material beyond it is what a bridged slot or keyway produces.
//!
//! Provenance: our own geometry over Tormach's public 1300PL manual
//! (UM10720: kerf ≈ 1.5x the orifice; a feature under the kerf cannot be
//! cut) and the LinuxCNC Plasma Primer; no vendor implementation read.
