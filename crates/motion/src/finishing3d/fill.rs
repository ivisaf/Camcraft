//! fill.rs - the land model (#1196): closed openings narrower than a
//! stated width are lidded at their rim on the DRIVE surface only, so a
//! 3D finish flies over bolt holes and small pockets instead of diving
//! down their walls.
//!
//! Provenance: grey-scale morphological closing with a flat disk
//! structuring element (Serra, *Image Analysis and Mathematical
//! Morphology*, 1982; Soille, *Morphological Image Analysis*, 2003) on
//! the model's top-down height field, and connected-component labelling
//! of the raised cells. The lid emission and the enclosure rule are our
//! own, written from geometry, not from any vendor's code or output.
//!
//! ## The laws here
//!
//! - **The fill rule.** On the height field `H(x, y)` (the topmost
//!   facet over each grid cell; no facet reads as the model's lowest Z),
//!   the closing `C = erode(dilate(H, disk), disk)` with a flat disk of
//!   the stated diameter `w` raises exactly the depressions the disk
//!   cannot enter, to the level where it can. A raised cell (more than
//!   `tol` above `H`) belongs to an opening; an opening is filled only
//!   when it is CLOSED - none of its cells on the grid border and every
//!   cell bordering it standing on material at the lid's own level
//!   (within one cell's 45-degree rise plus `tol`): a lid that would
//!   spill over a lower rim is not held, the feature is open. A slot or a valley that
//!   runs out to the part's edge is open and is never filled.
//! - **Only ever added.** The drive facets are the model's facets,
//!   untouched and in order, plus horizontal lids at `C` (never below
//!   `H`, which the closing guarantees and the code re-asserts). Every
//!   finishing law keeps the ball off EVERY facet it is given, so a
//!   path planned on a superset of the model can never bite the model
//!   deeper than one planned on the model itself - the fill can raise
//!   the path, never lower it. The verifier still judges the real
//!   model (the caller hands it the model, not these facets).
//! - **One cell of reach.** Lids cover the opening's cells plus the
//!   ring of cells around it, at each cell's own closed height, so no
//!   crack along the rim is wider than the grid's sampling error.
