//! M2.5 F: the offset shell - what makes the 3-D pocket's rings ride
//! the model's normals instead of the level grid.
//!
//! A level's ring loop walks the same XY region the plain ladder plans
//! (the islands' erosion - the dive superset law and every entry arm
//! read that region, unchanged); what the shell changes is the Z each
//! cut VERTEX lands on. For vertex `q` of a level at plane `z`:
//!
//! ```text
//! tip(q) = min(z, roof(q, r + ℓ) + leave)   floored at  max(z - stepdown, bottom_z)
//! ```
//!
//! The floor is the level's own stepdown budget (the same axial bite a
//! plain ladder's dive already takes) capped by the pocket's drawn
//! floor: the shell's early descent stops where the program stops.
//! Raising a tip can never uncover part material, so the floor rides
//! on the safe side of the clamp.
//!
//! `roof(q, rad)` is the model's highest facet top whose XY box reaches
//! within `rad` of `q` - a conservative stand-in for the surface `T`
//! over the whole decision disc. A part point p under the cutter at q
//! has T(p) ≤ roof, and part material ABOVE the plane never sits
//! within `r + leave` of a center-region point at all (that is the
//! islands' erosion, plain as ever), so `tip(q) ≥ T(p)` on every
//! below-plane point of the disc: a vertex bites part material nowhere.
//!
//! ## Why the chords are capped (the rising-leg gouge)
//!
//! A leg's Z interpolates linearly between its endpoints' tips, so a
//! point m(t) mid-leg is safe iff BOTH endpoints' decision discs reach
//! every part point under the leg near them. If a vertex's tip were
//! computed from the leg it merely ENDS (the endpoint formulation this
//! module first carried), the other side betrays it: the PREVIOUS leg
//! can be long while the vertex's own disc is short. Concrete gouge -
//! a vertical dive lands beside a step whose top T sits strictly
//! between `plane - stepdown` and the plane (the dive's disc, radius
//! r, never sees the step; its tip clamps to the floor). The next leg
//! is a long ring chord running past the step: at the crossing, the
//! leg's interpolated Z rises from the dive's floor tip toward the far
//! endpoint's, and while the disc still covers the step's column the
//! leg rides BELOW T - the sim (the column arm's `stock_sim::Stock::cut_chord`, which
//! removes everything above the chord's lowest reached Z at each
//! touched cell) drops the step's column below the model surface. A
//! gouge.
//!
//! Capping every XY leg at ℓ and taking each vertex's corridor to
//! `r + ℓ` closes it: a part point within r of a chord point is within
//! `r + ℓ` of BOTH that chord's endpoints, both tips bound its T, and
//! no interpolation between two bounds can fall under it. The cap
//! costs vertices, not depth: within one planar facet the tips along a
//! leg are equal anyway (the roof is constant there), so subdivision
//! adds only collinear, co-planar points - the same fidelity class as
//! every chord law in this codebase, bounded by the mesh's own
//! tessellation scale. This ladder takes ℓ = the tool radius, so a
//! vertex's decision disc is one tool diameter wide (see
//! `machining3d::ladder`).
//!
//! Where the surface is steep the roof outgrows the plane and the tip
//! stays AT it - the waterline the plain ladder always cut there;
//! where the surface is shallow the tip follows it at the leave
//! standoff, and the staircase's pyramid between plane and surface is
//! gone from the single pass.
//!
//! The roof is conservative on both sides of every leg: a facet counts
//! when its XY bounding box touches the corridor, and contributes its
//! global maximum z. A coarse mesh may then name a high vertex no
//! point of the tube reaches, and the tip rides up toward the plane -
//! the plain ladder's own cut, never deeper, never a gouge. The
//! verdict of what any of it leaves standing is the M2.3 simulation's,
//! here as everywhere.
//!
//! Provenance: our own design, specced from published CAM offset-shell
//! roughing behavior, per the Clean-Room Protocol.
