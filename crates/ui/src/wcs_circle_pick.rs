//! The WCS page's viewport picks: a click on an anchor marker (the box
//! points of the "Anchor on" grid) and, #739, a click on a circular edge
//! for the "Circle centre" anchor. Both win over the pick mode while
//! armed. The edge resolves through the one pick rule
//! (`feature_click`, edges only, one run per click); the circle itself is
//! the app's shared `pick::circle_centre`, read by the command the click
//! queues - nothing here measures geometry.
//!
//! Provenance: our own routing over our own pick API and commands; no
//! vendor material consulted.
