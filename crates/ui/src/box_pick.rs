//! The viewport box select (#979): Ctrl (or Shift) + left drag in Edge or
//! Face mode, with an operation open, draws a rubber band instead of
//! orbiting; its release adds every visible feature edge chain (Edge
//! mode) or welded face (Face mode) in the box - hidden ones too while
//! Pick through is on - to the operation's pick
//! list as ONE `SetOperationGeometry` - one undo step. A drag to the
//! right is a window (wholly inside), to the left a crossing box (inside
//! or touching). The geometry rule is the app's (`pick::box_select`, the
//! #692 one pick rule: feature chains only, nothing hidden unless Pick
//! through is on); this module
//! only arms the gesture and routes the answer.
//!
//! Provenance: rubber-band window/crossing selection as public CAD user
//! documentation describes it; our own routing over our own pick API. No
//! vendor material consulted.
