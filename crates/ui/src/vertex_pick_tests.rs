//! M13.4 law, on the one pick rule (#692 step 2): a Vertex-mode pick on a
//! cube seen down its body diagonal - the front corner and the hidden back
//! corner project onto the same pixel, and only the front one may win; a
//! corner hidden behind the part is never picked, in perspective or
//! orthographic, unless the app's explicit pick-through is asked for.
//!
//! Provenance: our own test, standard picking geometry.
