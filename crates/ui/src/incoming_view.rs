//! The incoming stock in the viewport (#406): while a setup's settings
//! page is open and its stock source is "What <previous setup> leaves
//! behind", the body the setups before it leave stands in the viewport
//! as a teal translucent sheet, apart from the setup's own Stock node.
//!
//! Provenance: our own display design over #317's carry and #320's
//! stock source; no vendor material consulted.
//!
//! ## The laws here
//!
//! - **Measured once per document version, never per frame.** [`refresh`]
//!   runs at the end of every `State::drain_actions`; it measures only
//!   when the key (setup, active setup, `doc_version`) moves, through
//!   `camcraft_app::setup_stock_view::incoming_shape` - one program sim
//!   for the sheet and for the page's box and volume.
//! - **Shown only while wanted, dropped when not.** A closed page, another
//!   page, or a setup taking its own stock clears the cache at once - the
//!   mesh is never held for a page nobody looks at.
//! - **A refusal draws nothing and says so once.** The reason is logged
//!   when measured (not per frame) and the page prints it; the scene
//!   gets no part.
//! - **View state, never a command.** Opening a page is not undoable; the
//!   sheet follows the page, the history is untouched.
