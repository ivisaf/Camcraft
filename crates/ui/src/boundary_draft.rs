//! The Boundary group's draft law (M11.5 UX, the user's hand-test): ONE
//! list of boundary entries over `AreaControls`' `extra` + `open`, each
//! with a role (Include / Exclude / Open - side A / Open - side B), what
//! its picks spell, and the roles its shape cannot take, disabled with
//! the reason. Viewport picks land here while the group is collecting:
//! a plain click takes ONE edge (a run - one straight stretch or one
//! arc, never the whole tangent loop), Ctrl toggles a run in or out
//! (Ctrl on an edge of a picked loop breaks it open), Shift closes the
//! picks around their face loop, Alt narrows any of them to the single
//! mesh segment. Everything here edits the page draft (`OpUi::area`):
//! Apply commits it as one undoable `EditOperationParams::with_area`, so
//! the history stays the one source of truth. Egui-free on purpose - the
//! page draws it, the tests drive it.
//!
//! Provenance: our own UI law; no vendor material consulted.
