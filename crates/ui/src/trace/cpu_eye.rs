//! The CPU march off the UI thread (M13.1 leftover): where no device
//! traces, one worker thread runs the sim's `preview` and publishes
//! the finished picture through a latest-only slot, the pattern the
//! playback worker (`app::stock_play_worker`) set. Provenance: the
//! plain latest-wins mailbox (a mutex-guarded job plus a condvar, a
//! single-item output slot) over std threads; nothing from vendor
//! binaries.
//!
//! ## The laws here
//!
//! - **The UI never waits on a march.** `request` overwrites the job
//!   the worker has not started (a camera that keeps moving coalesces
//!   to its newest pose) and `take` empties the slot without blocking.
//! - **A picture names what it was marched for.** Every answer carries
//!   its `Key`; the eye binds only a picture for the key it shows and
//!   throws a stale one away.
//! - **Refuse, never crash.** A refused march is published as `Err` by
//!   name; a poisoned lock reads as a lost worker. Dropping the handle
//!   stops and joins the thread.
