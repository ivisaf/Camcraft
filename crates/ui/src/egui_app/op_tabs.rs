//! The operation page's section tab bar: the specced named sections
//! (ROADMAP M1.4: "tabs and named sections (geometry, heights, passes,
//! leads and links, feeds) instead of long stacks"), which kinds have
//! which, and the strip that switches between them.
//!
//! M9.1 B folded the tabs into one stacked pane; user feedback reversed
//! that ("everything is just a lot to scroll thru - no organization"), so
//! the bar is back in its M1.4 shape: one tab per section the kind has
//! fields for (no dead tabs), each field on its own tab only, in its
//! within-section order. The open tab is `State::op_tab` - transient view
//! state, never a command, never saved: a click queues nothing.
//!
//! The mapping is by section, not by field: `pages::params_fields` guards
//! every field with the section it belongs to, so a field added under an
//! existing guard lands on that tab with no edit here. `has_section` only
//! answers which tabs a kind shows, and the registry-wide drift guard in
//! `tests.rs` renders every kind's every section to prove the answer
//! matches what the guards actually draw (both directions).
//!
//! Provenance: our own code (the M1.4 tab bar, restored from our git
//! history); no HSMWorks material involved.
