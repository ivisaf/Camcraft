//! The ColorVision layer (M13.4, DONE M6.1's named follow-on): protan,
//! deutan and tritan remaps of the colours that CARRY MEANING - the
//! Deviate verdict classes (clean / rest / gouge / unjudged), the
//! toolpath move kinds (feed / rapid / plunge), the viewport's
//! selection lift and the pages' warning / error / missing text inks
//! (per panel ground, gated against the body text and the panel
//! itself), applied on top of whatever theme is live. The
//! chrome tokens are not remapped: they are a blue-on-neutral
//! luminance design every dichromacy already reads, and the gate below
//! proves that per mode instead of trusting it.
//!
//! The law: under each remap, every pair that must be told apart stays
//! at least [`MIN_DE00`] apart (CIEDE2000 of the two colours as the
//! deficient eye sees them, simulated with Machado, Oliveira &
//! Fernandes 2009 - see `cvd`), and the live token table, seen through
//! the same eye, still passes `contrast::readable` (WCAG 2.1). A mode
//! that fails is refused at the pick, never rendered. `Off` is the
//! house palette byte for byte - the default changes no pixel.
//! Provenance: our own module and numbers; the simulation and the
//! metric are the published models cited in `cvd`; the remap's shape
//! (meaning on the blue-yellow and lightness axes for the red-green
//! deficiencies, on red-cyan and lightness for tritan) is general
//! colour-science practice. No vendor material consulted.
