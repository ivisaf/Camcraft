//! Vertex picks (M13.4): where a picked feature point sits, and the
//! work-origin moves a picked vertex or face drives (the WCS chips). The
//! pick itself is the app's one rule (#692 step 2, `crate::feature_click`):
//! a feature point - a corner, a sharp turn, an open edge's end - visible
//! under the cursor; never a vertex inside a face or along a round rim.
//!
//! Provenance: our own code over the app's pick and origin targets; the
//! screen marker is plain viewport projection. No vendor material
//! consulted.
