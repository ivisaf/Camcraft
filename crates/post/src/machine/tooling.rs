//! `tooling.spindle_mount` and `tooling.default_holder` (#828): the
//! holder system a machine's spindle takes, and the built-in library
//! holder a NEW tool on that machine starts with. Both optional - a file
//! without them reads as before. The holder library is not this crate's:
//! the caller passes its lookup in ([`HolderLookup`], the app's
//! `machine::holder_lookup`), so the post crate stays on cl and geometry
//! (maintainer, PR #880: no crate edge for a couple of items).
//!
//! Provenance: our own keys and rules, specced from the issue and the
//! manufacturers' public pages for which spindle a machine has (the
//! Tormach mills: https://www.tormach.com/tormach_mills/ - MX machines
//! BT30, PCNC and M machines an R8 spindle with TTS holders). One law at
//! two doors, as the plasma rules: the reader refuses the first broken
//! key, the Machines pane's validator lists them all, each BY NAME - an
//! unknown or mismatched holder is never read as "no default".
