//! Thread mills (#894): what the single-form and multi-form cutter records mean, their sanity law and the pitch door a thread-milling operation asks.
//!
//! Provenance: the ISO general-purpose metric thread profile (ISO 68-1
//! basic profile; ISO 724 basic dimensions: internal thread depth
//! 5/8 H = 0.5413 x pitch; ISO 965-1 / DIN 13 external design root:
//! 17/24 H = 0.6134 x pitch, H = 0.866 x pitch) and the thread-milling
//! chapters of public machine-tool handbooks (Machinery's Handbook,
//! "Thread milling"; Smid, "CNC Programming Handbook", helical milling):
//! a multi-form cutter carries rows of teeth at one pitch and finishes
//! the thread in one helical revolution, a single-form cutter carries one
//! row and rides one turn per thread, so it cuts a range of pitches. No
//! vendor catalog or CAM product material consulted.
//!
//! Pure module: no flecs, no I/O. A thread mill is a [`Tool`] of kind
//! [`ToolKind::ThreadMill`] (multi-form) or [`ToolKind::ThreadMillSingle`]
//! reading `diameter` (across the tooth crests), `tip_angle` (the form's
//! included flank angle), `pitch` (the multi-form's one pitch, the
//! single-form's coarsest), `pitch_min` (the single-form's finest),
//! `flute_len` (the cutting length: rows x pitch on a multi-form, the
//! tooth's height on a single-form) and `flutes` (cutting edges around).
//! A neck rides the drawn cutter outline ([`crate::cutter_profile`]).
