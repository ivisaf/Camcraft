An operation is one machining step: a tool, an area to cut, and how to cut
it. The ribbon shows the operation groups the mounted machine can run, so a
mill document has no turning operations and a lathe document no 3D
milling. A mill-turn shows both.

## Operation kinds

| Group | Operations |
|---|---|
| Milling 2D | Face, Contour, Pocket, Slot, Trace, Adaptive, Offset, Engrave, Chamfer, Circular, Thread |
| Milling 3D | 3D Pocket, 3D Finish, Deburr |
| Drilling | Drill, Bore, Probe |
| Multi-axis | 5-Axis Contour, 5-Axis Parallel, Swarf, Adv. Swarf, Rotary Contour, Rotary Parallel, Rotary Offset, Multi-Axis Rough, 5-Axis Flow, Multi-Axis Contour |
| Turning | Facing, Profile Rough, Profile Finish, Groove Rough, Groove Finish, Part, Threading, Chamfer, Taper, Multi-Pass, Form, Bore |

Some kinds carry several strategies. The 3D kinds cover adaptive roughing
per level, waterline, parallel, scallop, radial, spiral, morph, flow,
pencil and steep/shallow finishing. Drill covers spot, drill, peck, deep,
tap and bore cycles, and **Detect holes** finds the holes in the model for
you. Milling operations can also be indexed (3+2) to a tilted plane on a
machine that can tilt.

## The settings tabs

An operation's page groups its settings on tabs. A kind shows only the
tabs it has settings for:

- **Geometry:** the tool and what to cut. Pick faces, edges or loops in
  the viewport, then set containment, offset, extension and extra or open
  boundaries where the kind has an area.
- **Heights:** clearance, retract, top and bottom heights, and where each
  is measured from.
- **Passes:** stepover, stepdown, stock to leave and the kind's own
  strategy settings.
- **Lead in / Lead out:** how the tool enters, moves between levels and
  leaves the cut, and the links between cuts.
- **Feeds:** spindle speed and feed rates.
- **Machine:** only on the few kinds that drive a machine function of
  their own.

Edits on a page are pending until you click **Apply** or **Generate**.
Both are undoable with Ctrl+Z.

## What a click picks

Every page that takes a pick from the viewport (operation geometry,
boundaries, setup alignment, fixture mates, the work origin) follows the
same rule:

- **A face is the whole face.** Clicking anywhere on a flat face, or on a
  smooth curved wall, picks all of it, never one of the triangles the model
  is drawn with.
- **An edge is a real model edge:** where two faces meet at a crease, or the
  open border of a sheet. The lines between the triangles inside a face, or
  around a smooth wall, are never pickable.
- **A point is a corner** where model edges meet, or the end of an open
  edge. A vertex inside a face or along a round edge is not a point.
- **Only what you can see.** A click takes the surface in front, and an
  edge or a corner only when it is visible there. Nothing behind the part
  is picked through it; turn the view to reach it.
- **Only what the page asks for.** Near a feature, a corner wins over an
  edge and an edge over a face, but only among the kinds the page takes: a
  plane is picked by a face, so it never snaps to an edge.

Edge mode picks the face between the edges when no edge is under the
cursor; Alt+click picks a single edge segment instead of the whole chain.
The same rule holds for picks an AI agent makes over MCP by feature id: an
id a click could not have picked is refused by name.

## Generating

**Generate** computes the toolpath and checks it. An operation can be in
one of three states:

- **No toolpath yet:** it has never been generated.
- **Stale:** something it depends on (the model, the stock, the tool, the
  work offset or its own settings) has changed since it was generated.
  Generate it again.
- **Generated:** the cached toolpath matches its inputs.

When CamCraft cannot compute a safe path for some part of an operation, it
does not hand you a partial or guessed one: generation stops with a
message that names the setting or the geometry at fault. Moves the checks
flag as unsafe are marked in the viewport, and a message that names a place
can be clicked to frame it.

## Checking

- **Paths** shows every cached toolpath at once.
- **Simulate** plays the program against the stock with a transport bar;
  drag the playback slider to jump.
- **Deviate** compares the machined stock with the model and colours where
  material is left or where the program cut into the part. **Frame rest**
  and **Frame gouge** take the view to the worst spot of each.
