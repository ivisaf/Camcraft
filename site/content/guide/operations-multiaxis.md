This page is the reference for the kinds in the **Multi-axis** group of
the [operations](@/guide/operations.md) ribbon: 5-Axis Contour, 5-Axis
Parallel, 5-Axis Flow, Multi-Axis Contour, Swarf, Advanced Swarf, Rotary
Contour, Rotary Parallel, Rotary Offset and Multi-Axis Rough. For the
tabs themselves and what a click picks, see that page; for what a refusal
means in general, see [Reading a refusal](@/guide/refusals.md).

Lengths are in mm (inches in an inch document), feeds in mm/min (in/min),
angles in degrees. The defaults below are what a freshly created operation
starts with: feed 1200, plunge feed 300, climb milling on, clearance 25
above the stock top, top at the model top, bottom at the model bottom,
stepdown 5, stepover 3 and tolerance 0.05. A retyped operation keeps the
numbers it already had; a retype from an indexed (3+2) operation drops
its tilt.

## What every multi-axis kind shares

**The tool.** Every kind cuts with a ball-nose. A wrong tool is refused
by name ("'<tool>' is a <kind>; a <operation> operation cuts with a ...").

**The pose: lead, lag and max tilt.** Each kind carries the same three
angles on its Passes tab, all 0 / 0 / 90 on a new operation:

| Setting | What it does |
|---|---|
| Tool lead angle | leans the tool with the feed, off the surface normal (off the radial for the rotary kinds) |
| Tool lag angle | leans it across the feed (side tilt) |
| Max tilt | the cone the spindle may open from the normal; where the surface asks for more, the lean folds onto the cone's edge |

The ball's centre does not move when the tool leans: the pose decides
which way the spindle points, not where the cut lands, so every kind's
cut is verified against the model as a swept ball, within the kind's
tolerance.

**Avoid shank collisions** (5-Axis Contour, 5-Axis Parallel, 5-Axis Flow,
Multi-Axis Contour and Multi-Axis Rough; off by default). Where the posed
tool's shank would touch the part, the spindle tilts to the nearest clear
angle inside the max-tilt cone; positions never move. Where no angle in
the cone clears, generation stops: "the shank of the tool touches the part
at move ... of the posed path, and no pose inside the max-tilt cone (...
deg) clears it - widen the cone, shorten the tool, or turn shank avoidance
off". With the switch off, a shank that touches is still caught by the
verification at the post gate.

**Pose swings happen in air.** A pose change of more than 30 degrees
between moves below the clearance plane is refused ("... pose swing ...
deg at move ... - refused: a pose turn past 30 deg happens in air, never
on a cut"); the links retract, swing and plunge instead.

**The machine must reach the pose.** A leaning move needs a machine with
tilting rotaries. The machine check refuses each move the mounted machine
cannot hold, by name: "move ... tilts the tool; <machine> states no
tilting rotary", "move ... commands B ... deg; <machine> states no B
axis", "move ... commands A ... deg, the travel is ...". A machine whose
only rotary turns about X (a 4th-axis table) is judged through that one
axis: "<machine>'s only rotary, A about X, cannot reach that pose". The
built-in **Tilt-head 5-axis** machine can hold the poses; the plain VMC
cannot, so post multi-axis work with a machine that states its rotaries.

## 5-Axis Contour

**For:** finishing steep walls with waterline rings, with the tool leaning
off the wall. Choose it over 3D Finish's waterline when the holder or
shank would rub a deep wall at a vertical pose.

**Picks:** none; it rings the whole model.

| Tab | Setting | Default |
|---|---|---|
| Heights | Clearance Z / Top Z / Bottom Z | Top is the first ring's plane, Bottom the last level's |
| Heights | Hop below clearance (Retract Z) | off |
| Passes | Lead / lag / max tilt | 0 / 0 / 90 |
| Passes | Avoid shank collisions | off |
| Passes | Tolerance | 0.05: levels drop by 2 x sqrt(tool radius x tolerance) |
| Feeds | Feed / Plunge feed / Climb milling | 1200 / 300 / on |

## 5-Axis Parallel

**For:** raster finishing of open, shallow-to-moderate ground with a
leaning tool. Choose it over 3D Finish's parallel when a lead angle keeps
the ball off its dead centre on flat-ish ground.

**Picks:** none; it covers the whole model.

| Tab | Setting | Default |
|---|---|---|
| Passes | Stepover | Auto: from tolerance and tool by the scallop law, times the slope's cosine |
| Passes | Lead / lag / max tilt | 0 / 0 / 90 |
| Passes | Avoid shank collisions | off |
| Passes | Tolerance | 0.05 |
| Feeds | Feed / Plunge feed / Climb milling | 1200 / 300 / on |

A stated stepover is the flat-ground spacing; on a slope it follows the
terrain's cosine.

## 5-Axis Flow

**For:** the 5-Axis Parallel's lines, but following the surface's own
least-curving direction instead of a straight raster. Choose it on
blended, sweeping ground where straight lines cross the flow; flat ground
is cut in straight passes. The settings and defaults are 5-Axis
Parallel's; the direction is read from the model, not set.

## Multi-Axis Contour

**For:** riding the ball along picked model edges wherever they stand,
with a leaning tool: a chamfer or trace along a 3D edge. Choose it over
the 2D Trace when the edge is not in one plane.

**Picks:** one or more edge chains on the Geometry tab. A new one cuts
nothing until chains are picked: "multi-axis contour needs at least one
picked edge chain of two distinct points".

| Tab | Setting | Default |
|---|---|---|
| Heights | Clearance Z / Top Z / Bottom Z | the machining window; a chain outside it is refused, never clipped |
| Passes | Lead / lag / max tilt | 0 / 0 / 90 |
| Passes | Avoid shank collisions | off |
| Passes | Tolerance | 0.05 (the verify budget only; it authors nothing) |
| Feeds | Feed / Plunge feed / Climb milling | 1200 / 300 / on |

**Common refusals:** "Multi-Axis Contour needs a ball-nose tool, '...' is
a ..."; "picked chain ... stands at z ..., outside the window [..., ...]
- widen Top/Bottom of Part Z or re-pick"; "multi-axis contour found no
model to ride".

## Swarf

**For:** finishing ruled flanks (surfaces straight in one direction, such
as a drafted wall) with passes along the ruling. Choose it on ruled
walls; doubly-curved ground is 5-Axis Parallel work.

**Picks:** none; the ruling is read off the model.

| Tab | Setting | Default |
|---|---|---|
| Heights | Clearance Z / Top Z / Bottom Z | Top is the first line's plane, Bottom the last one's |
| Passes | Stepover | Auto: by the scallop law, across the ruling |
| Passes | Lead / lag / max tilt | 0 / 0 / 90 |
| Passes | Tolerance | 0.05 |
| Feeds | Feed / Plunge feed / Climb milling | 1200 / 300 / on |

**Common refusals:** "swarf found no ruling to follow - this surface
curves about the same in every direction; doubly-curved ground is 5-Axis
Parallel or Scallop work"; "this model's ruling runs along Z (vertical
walls): its flanks belong to the waterline rings, which is 5-Axis Contour
work"; "the ruling turns across the region - no single straight pass
direction follows it; split the ruled faces or finish with 5-Axis
Parallel"; "the mesh is too coarse for the ruling to be seen anywhere:
refine it or finish with 5-Axis Parallel".

## Advanced Swarf

**For:** Swarf run coarse to fine. Each rough pass relaxes the tolerance
fourfold and doubles the spacing; the last pass cuts to the stated
tolerance. Choose it over Swarf when one pass would take too much at
once.

Settings as Swarf, plus **Pass count** on the Passes tab: 2 on a new
operation, 1 to 4 (the panel clamps it). Refusals as Swarf.

## Rotary Contour

**For:** finishing a turned workpiece in rings around its axis, the tool
posed off the radial. The axis is fitted to the model, not set. Choose it
for a part standing on its axis; a bar lying flat is Rotary Parallel work.

**Picks:** none.

| Tab | Setting | Default |
|---|---|---|
| Heights | Clearance Z / Top Z / Bottom Z | mapped onto stations along the fitted axis: Top where the run starts, Bottom where it ends |
| Passes | Lead / lag / max tilt | 0 / 0 / 90, off the radial |
| Passes | Tolerance | 0.05: stations drop by the scallop law |
| Feeds | Feed / Plunge feed / Climb milling | 1200 / 300 / on |

**Common refusals:** "the model's normals share no rotation axis - a
turned workpiece is rotary work; finish a freeform with the 5-Axis
kinds"; "every axis fits this model equally - it curves the same the
world around; domed ground is 5-Axis Contour or Parallel work"; "the
work's axis lies flat on the table - a laid bar is finished with passes
along it: Rotary Parallel".

## Rotary Parallel

**For:** finishing a turned bar with passes along its fitted axis, spaced
around the turn. Choose it for a bar lying on the table.

Settings as Rotary Contour, plus **Stepover** (Auto: by the scallop law,
around the turn; a stated value is the spacing around the turn). Its
heights are read as radii about the bar's axis.

**Common refusals:** "the work stands on its axis - passes along a
standing bar are its rings: Rotary Contour"; "Rotary Parallel reads its
... height as a radius about the bar's axis: ... mm does not clear the
work's ... mm radius - raise it".

## Rotary Offset

**For:** roughing a turned bar by wrapping: each level peels a radial
infeed off the skin, the passes spaced around the bar. Choose it to rough
before Rotary Contour or Rotary Parallel.

| Tab | Setting | Default |
|---|---|---|
| Heights | Clearance Z / Top Z / Bottom Z | stations along the fitted axis; the ladder roughs only between them |
| Heights | Stepdown (radial) | 5 |
| Passes | Stepover | 3, in developed arc length around the bar |
| Passes | Stock to leave | 0 |
| Passes | Strategy | Auto (Zigzag, Waterline, Adaptive, Offset rings) |
| Passes | Lead / lag / max tilt | 0 / 0 / 90 |
| Passes | Tolerance | 0.05 (the verify budget) |
| Lead in / Lead out | Entry | Plunge, down the radial |

**Common refusals:** "the rotary wrap needs a closed solid, but the mesh
is open: ... edges bound one facet only (a hole in the skin)"; "a feature
that is not turned (a flat, a keyway, a cross hole) crosses the rotary
wrap's seam ..."; "the wrapped work has no radial extent to rough"; "the
height window leaves no station of the work to rough".

## Multi-Axis Rough

**For:** the 3D Pocket's level-by-level roughing, move for move, with the
spindle posed where a wall or corner needs it and vertical where a floor
does not ask. Choose it over 3D Pocket when the shank or holder would
reach a deep wall at a vertical pose.

**Picks:** none; it roughs around the whole model.

| Tab | Setting | Default |
|---|---|---|
| Heights | Stepdown | 5 |
| Passes | Stepover / Stock to leave | 3 / 0 |
| Passes | Strategy | Auto (Zigzag, Waterline, Adaptive, Offset rings) |
| Passes | Lead / lag / max tilt | 0 / 0 / 90 |
| Passes | Avoid shank collisions | off |
| Passes | Tolerance | 0.05 (the verify budget) |
| Lead in / Lead out | Entry | Plunge |

Its refusals are the 3D Pocket's, plus the pose checks above.
